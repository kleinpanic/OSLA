CERN OHL Weakly Reciprocal 2.0:
Permissions of this weakly-reciprocal license are conditioned on making available complete sources of licensed works and modifications under the same license. Notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without sources for the larger work.
